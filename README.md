# FlappyBirdySmart
This is a Unity project I made to get a better understanding of implementation of Unity's ML-Agents library(v0.15)

## Overview of the game mechanics
* A replica from the popular game [Flappy Bird](http://flappybird.io/)
* The bird can sort of fly up to avoid the obstacles
* The gravity pulls the bird down
* The obstacles are spawned randomly with variation in gaps between them

## Assets:
* The backgrounda and obstacles (pipes) created using GIMP
* The bird sprites used from [xstrack1's assets](https://github.com/xstreck1/Flappy-Agents)

## ML Agents(v0.15)
* Unity's mlagents toolkit, made for creating a game AI
* Please refer to the official description and setup [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)
